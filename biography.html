								<h2>Hi, my name is Adelson!</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/foto.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I was born in 1992 in the city of Santo andre - Sao Paulo. My interest of electronics started in my childhood, when i saw Printed Circuit boards as "small cities".</p>
							<p>In 2015 I obtained my <strong>Bachelor's</strong> degree in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> from FEI. During my undergraduate studies I worked as intern in different companies. First at Vitopel, an industry, doing electronic and electrical maintenance. Thereafter at an IT company SETIS, developing software for electronic payment systems. </p>
							<p>I then went on to do my <strong>Master's</strong> program in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) under supervision of Prof. Elnatan Chagas Ferreira, and was able to complete it in 2018. I developed my master's research at the Laboratory of Instrumentation, Sensors and Embedded systems (LISSE), under the title "Development of a smart system for measuring electric consumption based on Power Line Communication". During this period, I had the opportunity to develop skills in mixed signal circuit design, development of embedded systems and digital communication principles.
							</p>
							<p>After my master's, I participated in a <strong>R&D project</strong> with a local technology company Techplus, located in Campinas, Sao Paulo. The group was responsible to develop a proof-concept of an autonomous wireless sensor node for industry 4.0. I was responsible for the implementation of power management circuit for energy harvesting. This challenge contributed to deepen my knowledge in energy harvesting, supercapacitors and power management circuits, in addition to offering me the opportunity <strong>to work with very skilled people</strong> in hardware and software.
							</p>	
							<p>In the same period of the above R&D project, I have started a <strong>Ph.D</strong> in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> in the same laboratory at Unicamp under supervision of Prof. José Antônio Siqueira Dias. My research focus is design signal processing circuits for reconfigurable smart sensors applied in agriculture. I am working with precision circuits to sensing a novel sensor structure.

							</p>
							<p> I have taken the following graduate courses:</p>
